# Linux runtime ABI compatibility

Build and verify the complete runtime against Ubuntu 22.04 / glibc 2.35.

## Context

An Ubuntu 22.04 user reported that libvispython could not load because the artifact
required newer glibc. Runtime CI/release and Vis native builds used Ubuntu 24.04;
Vis container exports used Debian bookworm (glibc 2.36). Static libpython would not
remove libc requirements from the bridge, workers or extension modules. Keep the
bundled shared-library ABI and build against the supported baseline instead.

## Phases

1. **Runtime build and archive checks**
   - Rationale: all delivered ELF objects must support the same libc baseline.
   - Data: `.github/workflows/{ci,release}.yml`, `scripts/check-linux-abi.sh`,
     `scripts/verify-platform-archive.sh` and release/source tests.
   - Acceptance criteria: both Linux architectures build/test on Ubuntu 22.04;
     every archive ELF, including bundled uv, passes the glibc 2.35 gate. Extracted
     uv creates a project environment offline and runs the extracted interpreter;
     extracted workers pass worker tests.
   - Unknowns: release-tag builds must repeat these checks on all four platforms.
2. **Vis consumers**
   - Rationale: engine, TUI and downloaded Python sidecar must be compatible together.
   - Data: Vis native-release workflow, Dockerfile, `bin/verify-linux-abi`, release tests.
   - Acceptance criteria: baseline builders, ABI gates, native/SDK/PTY tests before
     publication. Preserve concurrent pipeline-order changes from another session.
   - Unknowns: current released runtime assets are unchanged; a verified new runtime
     release and subsequent Vis dependency pin are needed to deliver the correction.
3. **Verify and deliver**
   - Rationale: source tests alone do not prove native Linux compatibility.
   - Data: affected tests, shellcheck, actionlint, formatting/lint and native artifacts.
   - Acceptance criteria: local checks pass; Linux builds and runtime tests pass;
     publish a new immutable runtime tag and pin its commit in Vis.
   - Unknowns: none about authorization; the user requested the runtime release.

## Plan state

The bundled-uv and Ubuntu 22.04 changes are committed and pushed. CI run
34475322579 passed complete builds, JVM tests, archive ABI checks and extracted
worker tests on Linux x64/arm64 and macOS x64/arm64. The local macOS archive also
passed offline uv sync/check/run with an empty tool PATH and the extracted Python.
Vis JVM, native uv parity and native package-worker checks pass locally; its
packager now rejects a sidecar without executable uv or its licenses.

Runtime v0.5.7 release preparation is in progress. Release-tag verification and
publication, the consuming Vis dependency pin and final consumer checks remain.
