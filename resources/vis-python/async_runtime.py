# come. That is silent data loss, and the very next tool (`git commit -F <file>`)

# ── DESCRIPTOR RECLAMATION + CEILING: the same non-refcounting fact, with a much
# harsher failure. A dropped handle also keeps its PROCESS file descriptor: the
# object is collected but the fd is not closed, and neither `__del__` nor weakref
# callbacks ever run (measured: 200 dropped `open()`s = +200 live descriptors,
# two `gc.collect()`s reclaim none of them). A loop over a big tree
# (`open(p).read()` per file) therefore walks the WHOLE process into EMFILE, and
# the first casualty is not Python: `ProcessBuilder` can no longer fork, so every
# later `shell` call dies with the JDK's misleading "spawn helper / JDK
# version mismatch" text and the session is wedged for good.
#
# So the sandbox reclaims descriptors itself, where the leak is — the way
# CPython's refcount would. Every handle is registered under its fd with a WEAK
# ref; once that ref is dead the handle can never be read again, so its fd is
# closed by hand. GraalPy's weak refs do die on their own under ordinary JVM GC,
# so the common sweep is a cheap fstat pass with NO `gc.collect()` (a collect
# here costs ~270ms; it is the fallback, not the rule). Identity (`st_dev`,
# `st_ino`) is re-checked before every close, so a recycled fd number is never
# stolen from whoever owns it now. `__vis_fd_max__` is the ceiling that cannot be
# crossed: reaching it raises a normal Python `OSError(EMFILE)` naming the fix,
# instead of leaving the session to die later on an unrelated toolchain error.

# -> a real socket (`requests` is pure Python over urllib, and `httpx`/`urllib3`
# are layers on top of `requests`), so a response whose body is never fully read
# leaks a CONNECTED descriptor exactly the way a dropped `open()` leaks a file:
# measured, 20 dropped unread responses = +63 process descriptors, reclaimed by
# neither two `gc.collect()`s nor the block boundary, and counted by nothing — a
# socket is minted by `socket.socket(...)`, never by `open`, so the ceiling that
# exists to keep the session out of EMFILE never saw one.
#
# A socket cannot reuse the file identity: `fstat` on one reports
# `st_dev == st_ino == 0` (measured), so every socket looks like every other one
# and the recycled-number guard would eventually close the JVM's OWN connections.
# A socket's identity is its ADDRESS PAIR, `(getsockname(), getpeername())`,
# captured at every point the sandbox touches it while it is still alive —
# creation, `connect`, `bind`, and each sweep — because a socket is born ANONYMOUS
# and only becomes identifiable once it is connected or bound. The number is
# re-checked after the fact by REBINDING a probe onto it:
# `socket.socket(fileno=fd)` adopts a descriptor without duplicating it,
# `detach()` hands it back untouched and `close()` reclaims it (all measured).
