# Guest-side repair for the redirect GraalPy throws away.
#
# `subprocess.run(..., stdout=open(path, 'w'))` never reaches `path` in this
# runtime. GraalPy hands the host a plain INHERIT for every file or descriptor
# redirect, so the bytes go to whatever fd 1 the JVM owns — under a foreground
# gateway, the operator's terminal — and the file the extension named stays
# empty. A `stdin=` file is worse than lost: the child inherits the JVM's own
# stdin and blocks forever waiting for input the extension already supplied.
#
# The host `ProcessHandler` cannot repair this, because the guest's choice is
# already gone by the time a `ProcessCommand` reaches it. So the translation
# happens here, while the choice is still a Python object: a redirect GraalPy
# would discard becomes a pipe, and a daemon thread copies bytes between that
# pipe and the descriptor the extension actually asked for.
#
# The second repair is the pid. Emulated posix answers `Popen.pid` with a
# per-context child-slot index that it recycles after a reap, so the handle
# named no OS process and, once the slot was reused, named a stranger. The host
# hands over the pid it really started (`python-process-handler/pid-handoff`)
# and the slot index is kept for the syscalls that are keyed on it.
