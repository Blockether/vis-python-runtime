# vis sandbox POSIX refusal shim.
#
# `subprocess`, `os.system` and `os.popen` NEVER spawn here — not even when the
# shell tools are ON. Every process in this product starts through the ONE
# `shell` tool, which owns the containment (workspace cwd, process jail), the
# handle (`status`/`logs`/`wait`/`type`/`stop`), the log file on disk and the
# trace record. A second spawn door would be a second, weaker copy of all of
# that, and the model reaches for whichever door it remembers first.
#
# Without this shim the attempt dies as an opaque native-access error, so the
# shim exists ONLY to say where to go instead — and it says it in the HOST's
# words: every sentence comes from `__vis_process_surface__`, the Python view of
# `env_python/PROCESS_SURFACE`, which the prompt block and the handle refusal
# read too. No wording is spelled twice.
#
# WHICH sentence is true depends on the `shell` toggle, which can change between
# two blocks of one session, so the tool is looked up in globals() (or the `vis`
# module) at CALL time and never bound at import:
#
#   * shell ON  — the rule, then the invocation, because the work is doable.
#   * shell OFF — the toggle turned BOTH doors off, so nothing here suggests
#     `subprocess` is the way around a disabled shell.
#
# Installed once per sandbox context by
# env_python/install-process-surface!, right after the apropos/doc introspection.
